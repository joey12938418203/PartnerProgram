# PartnerProgram
This is a project done for a university class on data wrangling and visualization.

The data analyzed is sales data from a fabricated tech company that recently invested in a partner network. The analysis was done using R and seeks to investigate the impacts of this partner network.

The questions asked are:

In what ways do partnered deals differ from classic deals?

Are there differences in factors such as win rate, deal size, account size, time in pipeline or region?
